# Petri nets

This directory formalises **place/transition (P/T) Petri nets** and their basic theory.

## Design

- **Weighted arcs.** A net has a type of places and a type of transitions, and two weight maps
  `pre` and `post` from transitions to markings. Markings are finitely supported functions
  `Place →₀ ℕ`, so places and transitions can be arbitrary types, finite or infinite.
- **Semantics through `LTS`.** The marking graph of a net is an `LTS` whose labels are the
  transitions (`PetriNet.lts`). Reachability, bisimilarity, trace equivalence, and HML are therefore
  inherited from [Foundations](../../Foundations) and [Logics](../../Logics). The marking graph is
  deterministic.
- **Notation.** The scoped notation (`•[N] t`, `M [t⟩[N] M'`, `M ⇝[N] M'`, `⦅a, b⦆`) takes its net
  through the `net%` elaborator, which accepts anything with a `PetriNet.ToPetriNet` instance, so
  that other presentations of nets can use the same notation.

## Contents

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `Elab` | the `net%` elaborator, which lets the notation accept other kinds of nets |
| `Basic` | nets, markings, enabling, firing; token counts; notation |
| `Semantics` | marking graph, reachability, boundedness, safeness, liveness, conservative nets |

## Plans and notes

- Not yet formalised: reachability for unbounded nets, the Karp–Miller tree, coloured and
  inhibitor-arc nets.
